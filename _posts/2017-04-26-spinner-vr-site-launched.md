This is the first post for our new blog where I, Ido Wolf, will be covering fun and significant hallmarks during our progress developing the game.

For those interested, the website and our blog are hosted on GitHub Pages as a branch of our project (/gh-pages). It is a static blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is perfect for blogs powered by static hosting. Check out [the wonderful guide by Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) if you'd like to start your own static-hosted blog :)
